#### 4. Install project dependencies using npm:

* Install Express: `npm install express`

* Install Nodemon: `npm install -D nodemon`

* Install Date-fns: `npm install date-fns --save`

#### 5. Start the local server:

* Update the ***package.json*** file. 

* In it, there is a property called ***scripts***. 

* Modify the following code: `"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"`. 

* Instead, replace it with `"dev": "nodemon ./src/index.js"`. With this change, you will be able to start the local server using the command: `npm run dev`.
